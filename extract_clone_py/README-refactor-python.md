# AST-Based Python Code Clone Extraction & Analysis

This project provides an automated pipeline for analyzing Python code clones. Using the `tree-sitter` parsing library, the pipeline extracts Abstract Syntax Trees (AST) from target Python source files, performs detailed data-flow analysis across specific code regions (Pre, Within, and Post clone boundaries), detects code extraction hazards, and outputs an augmented dataset alongside an interactive HTML visualization.

```

## Prerequisites

Ensure your environment has the correct version of the Tree-sitter Python bindings. Because the pipeline relies on the `0.25.x` C-ABI, you must use version `0.25.0`.

```bash
pip install tree-sitter tree-sitter-python==0.25.0

```

## Pipeline Execution

### 1. Generate Test Data

If you are running this for the first time or need to reset the sample data, generate the continuous, functional mock code and the corresponding input JSONL:

```bash
python setup_test_data.py

```

This will populate the `data/` folder with `sample_python.jsonl` and `systems/security_helper.py`.

### 2. Run the Analysis Orchestrator

Execute the main script to parse the source code, extract data-flow contexts, filter out hazardous extractions, and generate the output artifacts:

```bash
python main_python.py \
    --jsonl ./data/sample_python.jsonl \
    --base-dir ./data \
    --output ./data/clone_visualization.html \
    --out-jsonl ./data/augmented_sample_python.jsonl

```

*(Note: You can also use `./run.sh` if you have configured it to run these steps sequentially.)*

## Core Architecture

### 1. AST Traversal & Scope Tracking (`util_ast_python.py`)

This module handles all Tree-sitter node queries. It bridges the gap between Python's dynamic typing and rigid block-scoped languages by simulating scope boundaries (classes, functions, lambdas). It maps exactly what variables are defined and mutated using assignments (`=`), augmented assignments (`+=`), and loop bindings (`for x in...`).

### 2. Data-Flow Analysis

The pipeline divides the enclosing function into three distinct execution regions relative to the clone code block:

* **PRE Region**: Code executed before the clone. Tracks initialized variables and parameters.
* **WITHIN Region**: The clone itself. Tracks variables Read (VR) and Written (VW) to determine inputs (`In`) and outputs (`Out`) required to extract the clone into a standalone function.
* **POST Region**: Code executed after the clone. Tracks variables that rely on the clone's output.

### 3. Hazard Detection & Filtering (`main_python.py`)

Clones are evaluated for extraction safety. A clone is dropped from the dataset if:

* **Full-Function Clone**: The clone spans the entire body of the enclosing method.
* **Data-Flow Hazard**: The clone writes to multiple local variables that are subsequently used in the POST region (Python methods standardly return a single execution flow, making multiple state mutations complex to cleanly extract).
* **Control-Flow Hazard**: The clone contains unbalanced jumps (`return`, `break`, `continue`) that disrupt the enclosing method's execution path.
* **Type Mismatches**: Sub-instances within a clone class have diverging inferred signatures (e.g., one requires a `dict` input, while the other requires a `list`).

## Output Artifacts

1. **`augmented_sample_python.jsonl`**: A rich dataset where each clone object includes inferred method signatures, `In(i)` / `Out(i)` sets, type maps, and hazard boolean flags.
2. **`clone_visualization.html`**: A syntax-highlighted HTML report mapping the clones line-by-line, visually marking Read/Write variables, inferred parameters, and regional bounds.
